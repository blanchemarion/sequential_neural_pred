# NethoBench

NethoBench evaluates neural, behavioural and multimodal neural-behavioural generative models by measuring the realism or plausibility of generated traces. Each of the three modes is covered by its own command, and which is appropriate depends on the nature of the generated traces: synthetic neural traces should be evaluated using `neuro-scores`, `fidelity-scores` and `neuro-analysis`, synthetic behavioural traces should use `etho-scores` and `etho-analysis` and multimodal traces `cross-scores` and `cross-analysis`.

**Outputs:**
1. **Neuro:** Structural neural realism (Distribution, Temporal, Relational, Geometry, State Dynamics).
2. **Fidelity:** Direct trace-alignment (Error, Mutual Information).
3. **Behavior:** Pose and kinematics realism.
4. **Cross-modal:** Neural-behavioral coupling (CCA, Predictive $R^2$, Lead-Lag).
5. **Multimodal Composite:** Average across available domains.

## Install
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

## Run the compact test fixtures
The repository includes small neural, behavioral, and multimodal fixtures under
`tests/resources/data/`. These files use the default `sequenceId` /
`itemPosition` schema, so no config file is needed.

```bash
mkdir -p outputs/quickstart
```

**Neural and fidelity scores**
```bash
nethobench neuro-scores \
  --gt tests/resources/data/neural/ground-truth/gt-ba4.csv \
  --preds tests/resources/data/neural/predictions/preds-ba4.csv \
  --json-out outputs/quickstart/neuro-ba4.json

nethobench fidelity-scores \
  --gt tests/resources/data/neural/ground-truth/gt-ba4.csv \
  --preds tests/resources/data/neural/predictions/preds-ba4.csv \
  --json-out outputs/quickstart/fidelity-ba4.json
```

**Behavioral scores**
```bash
nethobench etho-scores \
  --gt-dir tests/resources/data/behavioural/behav-ground-truth.csv \
  --inf-dir tests/resources/data/behavioural/behav-predictions.csv \
  --json-out outputs/quickstart/behavior
```

**Cross-modal scores**
```bash
nethobench cross-scores \
  --gt tests/resources/data/cross/cross-ground-truth.csv \
  --preds tests/resources/data/cross/cross-predictions.csv \
  --json-out outputs/quickstart/cross
```

The full test suite can be run with `pytest -q`.

## CLI Usage
All commands output JSON scores; `-analysis` commands also generate figures.

**Neural**
```bash
nethobench neuro-scores --gt gt.csv --preds pred.csv --config config.json
nethobench fidelity-scores --gt gt.csv --preds pred.csv --config config.json
nethobench neuro-analysis --gt gt.csv --preds pred.csv --config config.json
```

**Behavioral**
```bash
nethobench etho-scores --gt-dir gt.parquet --inf-dir pred.csv --config config.json
nethobench etho-analysis --gt-dir gt.parquet --inf-dir pred.csv --config config.json
```
`--gt-dir` and `--inf-dir` accept either a single `.csv` / `.parquet` file or a
directory containing `.csv` / `.parquet` files.

**Multimodal**
```bash
nethobench cross-scores --gt gt.csv --preds pred.csv --config config.json
nethobench cross-analysis --gt gt.csv --preds pred.csv --config config.json
```



### Config Schema (`config.json`)

Configuration is optional if the data contains the columns "sequenceId" and "itemPosition", and specific rules apply for different CLIs:

- `neuro`: any column that isn't `sequenceId` or `itemPosition` is considered a neuro column
- `etho`: all body part coordinates end in `_X` and `_Y`, `CENTER`, `NOSE` and `TAIL_BASE` are part of the body part coordinate stems
- `cross`: same as etho for coordinate variables, any columns that aren't `sequenceId` or `itemPosition` and don't end in `_X` or `_Y` are inferred to be neuro columns

The configuration options are broadly divided into two categories:
- **Data Schema Mappings** (which tell NethoBench how to read your multimodal datasets)
- **Data-Dependent Hyperparameters** (which adjust evaluation bounds based on your dataset's frame rate, length, or available compute).

### 1. Data Schema Mappings
These options map your dataset's columns to the semantic features NethoBench expects. If omitted, NethoBench will attempt to auto-infer them from the dataset headers.

*   **`sequence_key`**: *(string)* The column name identifying discrete sequences or trials. Defaults to `"sequenceId"`.
*   **`time_key`**: *(string)* The column name tracking the chronological frame or time step within a sequence. Defaults to `"itemPosition"`.
*   **`neuro_cols`**: *(array of strings)* A list of column names corresponding to continuous neural regions, sensors, or ROIs.
*   **`behavior_parts`**: *(array of strings)* A list of tracked body parts. NethoBench expects these to have `_X` and `_Y` coordinate suffixes in the data (e.g., `["CENTER", "NOSE", "TAIL_BASE"]`).
*   **`center_part`**: *(string)* The primary point used for tracking global speed and trajectory kinematics. Defaults to `"CENTER"`.
*   **`body_axis`**: *(array of strings)* A two-element list defining the front and back of the subject for directional heading calculations. Defaults to `["NOSE", "TAIL_BASE"]`.

### 2. Data-Dependent Hyperparameters
These values fine-tune the statistical bounds and metrics algorithms. They are typically adjusted based on your dataset's sampling frequency, memory constraints, or expected physiological bounds.

*   **`WELCH_SAMPLING_FREQUENCY`**: *(float)* Base sampling rate used for PSD and bandpower estimations. Default: `30.0`.
*   **`WELCH_NPERSEG`**: *(int)* Window size for Welch's spectral density estimation. Default: `256`.

*   **`AUTOCORR_MAX_LAG`**: *(int)* Maximum lag calculated for autocorrelation agreement. Default: `48`.
*   **`DFC_STATE_CONFIGS`**: *(list of tuples)* Defines `(window_size, step_size, n_states)` for Dynamic Functional Connectivity calculations. Default: `[[45, 15, 8], [60, 30, 8], [90, 30, 8]]`.
*   **`CHUNK_SIZE_EMBEDDINGS`**: *(int)* Frame window size used to generate movement manifold embeddings. Default: `5`.

**Compute & Subsampling Limits**
*   **`MAX_TIME_STEPS_SUBSAMPLE`**: *(int)* Maximum time steps sampled for heavy distribution bounds (like Quantile and MI scores) to prevent memory overload. Default: `1200`.
*   **`LATENT_SUBSAMPLE_SIZE`**: *(int)* Number of points sampled for global topology/manifold metrics. Default: `96`.
*   **`N_POINTS_MANIFOLD_PH_KNN`**: *(int)* Points sampled for K-Nearest Neighbors manifold comparisons. Default: `128`.
*   **`MAX_SEQUENCES_STRATIFIED`**: *(int)* Number of sequences evaluated during stratified topology metrics. Default: `48`.

*   **`MI_MAX_POINTS`**: *(int)* Point limit evaluated when generating pairwise Mutual Information matrices. Default: `1500`.

**Algorithm Heuristics & Thresholds**
*   **`PCA_VARIANCE_THRESHOLD`**: *(float)* The target explained variance used to dynamically select the number of principal components. Default: `0.85`.
*   **`STATIONARY_THRESHOLD_PERCENTILE`**: *(int)* The global speed percentile below which a subject is considered "stationary". Default: `10`.
*   **`SPEED_OUTLIER_PERCENTILE`**: *(int)* Used to cap extreme velocity outliers in histograms. Default: `99`.

*   **`KMEANS_K_SYLLABLE`**: *(int)* Target cluster count for local kinematic "syllable" scoring. Default: `8`.
*   **`MI_N_NEIGHBORS`**: *(int)* The number of neighbors used in continuous Mutual Information regression. Default: `5`.
*   **`LEAD_LAG_MIN_ARRAY_SIZE`**: *(int)* Minimum valid overlap window needed to compute lead/lag cross-correlation. Default: `5`.

## Metric Composites

The active neural benchmark bounds all scores to `[0, 1]` (higher is better) and computes a weighted final score:

- **Distribution ($D$):** KL/JSD, Quantiles, Moments, Mean.
- **Temporal / spectral ($T$):** Equal average of trajectory-distribution,
  autocorrelation, and power-spectral-density agreement.
- **Relational ($R$):** Graph, Cross-region MI, Lagged Covariance, Impulse Response.
- **Geometry ($G$):** Manifold persistence, Subspace Angle.
- **State Dynamics ($S$):** Occupancy and Transition.

$$ \mathrm{Neuro} = 0.22D + 0.18T + 0.24R + 0.18G + 0.18S $$

Fidelity is calculated separately:

$$ \mathrm{Fidelity} = 0.65 \, s_{Error} + 0.35 \, s_{MI} $$


## Metric Dictionary

### 1. Neuro Metrics (`neuro-scores`)
Evaluates the structural, dynamic, and relational realism of generated neural traces.

**Distribution Family ($D$)**
*   **`KL_or_JSD_score`**: Measures the tail-binned histogram overlap between ground truth and predicted traces using Symmetric KL Divergence.
*   **`Mean_score`**: Region-wise mean shift, normalized by the robust Interquartile Range (IQR).
*   **`QNT_score`**: Quantile distance focusing on the tail distributions.
*   **`MOM_score`**: Agreement across statistical moments (variance, skewness, and kurtosis).

**Temporal / Spectral Family ($T$)**
*   **`TRJDIST_score`**: Pooled latent occupancy and velocity-distribution agreement stabilized by latent path features (speed, turning, path length).
*   **`ACF_score`**: Agreement of raw-trace and increment autocorrelation curves at fixed physical lags, computed within each sequence.
*   **`PSD_score`**: Geometric combination of Welch spectral-shape overlap and total-power agreement, computed within each sequence and region.

The three headline temporal scores have fixed equal weight. NethoBench also
reports `PSDShape_score`, `PSDPower_score`, and
`DirectionalDynamics_score` as diagnostics; these sidecars do not receive
additional composite weight. See
[`docs/psd_integration.md`](docs/psd_integration.md) for the exact definition,
aggregation, and configuration.

**Relational Family ($R$)**
*   **`GRAPH_score`**: Graph network similarity evaluating top-edge topology, weighted degree, and local clustering agreement based on functional connectivity.
*   **`CrossRegionMI_score`**: Pairwise mutual information matrix similarity between regions.
*   **`LaggedCovariance_score`**: Cross-region lagged covariance similarity at multiple time steps.
*   **`ImpulseResponse_score`**: Similarity of Vector Autoregressive (VAR(1)) system coefficients.

**Geometry Family ($G$)**
*   **`MANI_score`**: Persistent-homology lifetime agreement stabilized by local-neighborhood geometry (K-Nearest Neighbors).
*   **`SubspaceAngle_score`**: Principal angle similarity between the PCA-derived subspaces.

**State Dynamics Family ($S$)**
*   **`LatentStateOccupancy...`**: Similarity of state residence histograms using K-Means clustering (evaluated at $K=11, 12$).
*   **`LatentStateTransition...`**: Transition matrix similarity mapping how states evolve over multiple temporal lags.

For compatibility with earlier NethoBench releases, `neuro-scores` also emits
legacy metric aliases ending in `_score01` (for example, `TRJDIST_score01`) in
addition to the current names.

*   **`neural_to_behavior_similarity`**: The difference in predictive $R^2$ when mapping neural sequences to behavioral states via linear regression.
*   **`behavior_to_neural_similarity`**: The difference in predictive $R^2$ when mapping behavioral sequences back to neural activity.
